What is a Branch in Git terms?

Everything done in github by default is performed with a Master branch. 
This kind of means that you are confident about the files you submit and the choices you have made in your code.
However, when working on a project and you have several options on how to continue the code, you could set branches at that point. 

I found the following information on githubs introduction guide: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/
" Changes you make on a branch don't affect the master branch, so you're free to experiment and commit changes,
safe in the knowledge that your branch won't be merged until it's ready to be reviewed by someone you're collaborating with."


This will be very useful when working on projects together.
Every branch must have a descriptive name.
