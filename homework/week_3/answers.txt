1 ) Explain the difference between the == operator and the === operator.

The === operator checks if left and right are exactly the same.
The == also checks if left and right are the same but will be true more often
as it also considers type coersed outcomes as the same.


2) Explain what a closure is. (Note that JavaScript programs use closures very often)

Closure is when a variable is declared as var x = ... , inside of the curly braces of the function.A
As a result, the variable only exists inside the function, instead of in the whole script.



3) Explain what higher order functions are.

Functions that have other functions inside them.
This way you can write functions with “gaps” in them that will be filled later,
when the function outcome can be calculated.



4)Explain what a query selector is and give an example line of JavaScript that uses a query selector.

console.log(data.CSSselector). Something with CSS. Not using it this week so answer will be uploaded later.
